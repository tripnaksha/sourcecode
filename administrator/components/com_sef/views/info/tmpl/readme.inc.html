	<h2><a title="intro" name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
	<p>ARTIO JoomSEF is a Joomla! component that generates and allows
	creation of Search Engine Friendly (SEF) URLs for Apache and IIS,
	returns proper 404 status code for missing content, provides logging of
	404 errors, and creation of special "shortcut" URLs that allow the user
	to redirection to the new URL.</p>
	<p>Starting with version 1.3.0 JoomSEF also allows control of
	specific meta tags, such as description or keywords for each generated
	URL. JoomSEF comes with SEF support for most popular Joomla!
	components. Some of those are delivered free as part of the JoomSEF
	installation package and some are also available under commercial
	licence. If you are missing a support for your favourite component,
	ARTIO may develop it on request.</p>
	<p>This documents describes how to install and setup ARTIO JoomSEF
	Joomla! component. You can view this documentation again by selecting
	the "ARTIO JoomSEF Documentation" button from the ARTIO JoomSEF Control
	Panel.</p>

		<h3><a title="install" name="install"></a>Installation</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Upload the zip file to Joomla! using the component installer
			in the usual way.</li>
			<li>
			<p>If not processed automatically by installer (e.g. due to write
			restriction to file), adjust your .htaccess file. Please note, that
			some directives may not be supported with specific web server or
			dependant on its configuration. See the comments in file for details.</p>
			<p>Unsupported directives in .htaccess file are most common
			cause for seeing "500 Internal Server Error" message after JoomSEF
			installation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>For Apache, set your ".htaccess" file like this (this is
			file for Joomla 1.5.x):<br />

			<p>For older Joomla versions (1.0.x) see the original file in the
			website root (htaccess.txt), rename it to .htaccess and follow the
			comments within. Htaccess file for Joomla 1.0.x contains 2 rewrite
			rules sections. With JoomSEF installation, the latter must be
			uncommented (by default, it is commented out).</p>
			</li>
			<li>For IIS, see Configuring IIS.</li>
			<li>Ensure that SEF is enabled under Global Configuration in the
			Joomla! backend.</li>
			<li>Edit the JoomSEF configuration, Change Enable to yes and
			save.<br />
			This is necessary to ensure the default 404 document gets saved to
			the Joomla! database.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="iis" name="iis"></a>Configuring IIS</h3>
		<p>Since JoomSEF 1.3.2, support for IIS servers has been retested
		and updated.</p>
		<p>JoomSEF has been successfully tested on IIS5 and IIS6. As the
		installation process is rather complex, we provide just the basic
		steps and hints here. If you have problems setting this up, please
		contact our support team (please note that the support is a paid
		service).</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<h4>Configure PHP as ISAPI filter</h4>
			In your IIS website configuration, configure PHP to run as ISAPI
			filter. (recommended)</li>
			<li>
			<h4>Install ISAPI Rewrite Filter</h4>
			To make JoomSEF work on your IIS, you will further need a rewrite
			component similar to mod_rewrite to Apache. There is several of them
			available, both free or commercial. Staying with free solutions, it
			works e.g. with ISAPI_Rewrite Lite. From the others IISRewrite or
			ISAPI_Rewrite Full should be ok. We have also tested it with IIRF
			(Ionic's ISAPI Rewrite Filter) but this one was a bit buggy, although
			closes to the original Apache's mod_rewrite (hopefully author can fix
			it soon).<br />
			Download the chosen component and follow its documentation to
			install it.</li>
			<li>
			<h4>Create rewrite rules definition file</h4>
			<p>Create an .ini with rewrite rules for the rewrite components.
			The name of file and location may differ based on selected rewrite
			module. For ISAPI_Rewrite the file name is httpd.ini and should be
			store in the modules install directory. For details for your module
			check its documentation.</p>
			<p>The file analogy of the Apache's .htaccess. The rules needed
			may differ on component chosen, your server configuration and your
			usage needs. If you are unsure about configuring this (or also any of
			the previous steps), you may contact our support.</p>
			<p>In general you may copy the rules from the htaccess.txt file
			distributed with Joomla! and adjust them to match the rewrite
			component possibilities. Please note that every module has a slightly
			different set of rules that it supports. (e.g. ISAPI_Rewrite does NOT
			support %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f) and existing files need to be
			checked by other rule. E.g. for every RewriteRule, add [L,U]
			modifier.</p>
			<p>If your Joomla! installation is not located in the website
			root, you will need to add the relative path to all the RewriteRules.
			(to simulate Apache's RewriteBase setting). If your Joomla! is
			located directly in the web site root, just add "/" before the
			index.php in the 2nd part of the RewriteRules.</p>
			<p>Specific configuration may differ with different IIS Rewrite
			modules used and its versions (Helicon Isapi Rewrite 2 or 3) and also
			with Joomla versions 1.0 or 1.5.</p>
			<p>An example configuration for IIRF for the site located in
			subdirectory /joomla/demo would be following:</p>
			<pre>########## Begin - Joomla! core SEF Section<br />#<br />RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f<br />RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d<br />RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/index.php<br />RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (/|\.php|\.html|\.htm|\.feed|\.pdf|\.raw|/[^.]*)$  [NC]<br />RewriteRule /joomla/demo/(.*) /joomla/demo/index.php<br />RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization},L]<br />#<br />########## End - Joomla! core SEF Section<br /><br /><br />########## Begin - Rewrite rules to block out some common exploits<br />## If you experience problems on your site block out the operations listed below<br />## This attempts to block the most common type of exploit `attempts` to Joomla!<br />#<br /># Block out any script trying to set a mosConfig value through the URL<br />RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} mosConfig_[a-zA-Z_]{1,21}(=|\%3D) [OR]<br /># Block out any script trying to base64_encode crap to send via URL<br />RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} base64_encode.*\(.*\) [OR]<br /># Block out any script that includes a &lt;script&gt; tag in URL<br />RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (\&lt;|%3C).*script.*(\&gt;|%3E) [NC,OR]<br /># Block out any script trying to set a PHP GLOBALS variable via URL<br />RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} GLOBALS(=|\[|\%[0-9A-Z]{0,2}) [OR]<br /># Block out any script trying to modify a _REQUEST variable via URL<br />RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} _REQUEST(=|\[|\%[0-9A-Z]{0,2})<br /># Send all blocked request to homepage with 403 Forbidden error!<br />RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [F,L]<br />#<br />########## End - Rewrite rules to block out some common exploits<br /></pre>
			<p></p>
			</li>
			<h4>Configure the Custom Errors (optional)</h4>
			<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">NOTE: in the
			example below, Joomla! is installed in the virtual directory Joomla!</span>
			Using the Internet Services Manager, right-click the directory in
			which Joomla! is installed.
			<br />
			Select properties &gt;&gt; Custom Error
			<br />
			set the 404 to URL:/joomla/index.php
			<br />
			set the 405 to URL:/joomla/index.php
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="uninstall" name="uninstall"></a>Uninstall</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Uninstall the component using the component unistaller in
			the usual way.</li>
			<li>Restore your .htaccess file to the default version (see
			htaccess.txt) or remove it completely - depending on whether you will
			continue to use Joomla! default SEO or not.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="upgrading_free_to_paid"
			name="upgrading_free_to_paid"></a>Upgrading from free to paid version</h3>
		<p>If you have purchased a paid version of JoomSEF and you want to
		replace the free one without loosing the current configuration and
		already stored SEF URLs, please follow this procedure:</p>
		<ol style="padding-left: 5em">
			<li>from JoomSEF control panel, choose "Upgrade"</li>
			<li>from upgrade page, choose "Install from page"</li>
			<li>choose the installation file you have download from ARTIO
			website</li>
			<li>click the upgrade button</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="checklist" name="checklist"></a>Configuration
		Checklist</h3>
		<p>Make sure that:</p>
		<ol style="padding-left: 5em">
			<li>the .htaccess exists in the root of your Joomla! site</li>
			<li>the 3rd party section rules in .htaccess are uncommented</li>
			<li>the "RewriteBase" rule matches YOUR Joomla! installation</li>
			<li>Joomla! SEF is "ON" in site "Global configuration"</li>
			<li>JoomSEF is "ON" in site "JoomSEF configuration"</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="nonlatin" name="nonlatin"></a>Non-latin languages</h3>
		<p>If your web site uses non-latin languages (such as Greek,
		Hebrew, etc.), make sure to configure the character conversion map
		correctly in JoomSEF Configuration / Non-ASCII character replacements
		for all characters your language is using.</p>
		<p>The format you need to use is
		oldChar1|newChar1,oldChar2|newChar2,... .<br />
		Example: α|a,β|b,γ|c,...</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="autoupdate" name="autoupdate"></a>Automatic Updates</h3>
		<p>Starting with version 1.3.0, JoomSEF provides automatic updates
		capabilities. From version 2.0.x automatic upgrades also apply to
		JoomSEF extensions.</p>
		<p>Thanks to this feature, it is no longer needed to uninstall and
		install the component each time you want to upgrade to newer version.
		After activating the automatic upgrade tool in the JoomSEF control
		panel, the component will check, whether newer version is available
		on-line and if yes, it will automatically download it and install
		rewriting your current version.</p>

	<h2><a title="tips" name="tips"></a>Useful Usage Tips</h2>
	<ol
		style="list-style-type: upper-roman; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside">
		<li>
		<h3><a title="config" name="config"></a>Configuration</h3>
		<p>Using the ARTIO JoomSEF configuration is fairly straight
		forward. For more information on each item hover your mouse over the
		blue (i) images when you are in the configuration screen.</p>
		<p>When you save the configuration it will remove all your URL's
		from the database. If you have a high traffic site it may be wise to
		put it offline before saving the ARTIO JoomSEF config or purging the
		database and go and browse your site starting at the main page. This
		will create the URL's properly for you and prevent numbers from being
		added to the ends of URL's people were browsing that changed.</p>
		<p>You may want to purge the 404 log before creating fresh urls.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="optimize" name="optimize"></a>Optimization</h3>
		<p>To achieve maximum performance, you should consider several
		things.</p>
		<p>Always have the latest JoomSEF version installed as we continue
		optimizations with every release.</p>
		<p>Enable Joomla! caching.</p>
		<p>Use JoomSEF Configuration to turn SEF off for those components
		you do not need it or which generate too many unoptimized links.
		Typically when you note links like 45.html, 46.html, ..., something is
		probably wrong.</p>
		<p>If certain component is using pagination, sorting and similar
		parameters an advanced configuration option <em>"Append non-SEF
		variables to URL"</em> may significantly reduce a number of SEF links
		generated and thus also your DB load. However, please note that the
		excluded variables will be reappended to your URL in standard form as
		&amp;varname=value.</p>
		<p>JoomSEF will always be a DB-driven SEO component. It will
		produce very nice and highly editable URLs for you, but for the cost
		of higher load for your DB. When configured properly and cached, the
		load increase should not be significant, but especially with big and
		frequently visited sites, pay a special attention to configuration and
		installed modules and plan your SEO carefully.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="duplicates" name="duplicates"></a>Preventing
		duplicates</h3>
		<p>If you are facing duplicate content items links e.g. <em>http://yoursite.you/article.html</em>,
		<em>http://yoursite.you/article-2.html</em>, etc. that lead to the
		same content, this is most probably caused by so called "Itemid"
		variable (although there may be other reasons also).</p>
		<p>The Itemid is internal Joomla! variable used to identify the
		source of a URL link. E.g. main menu or sub menu item that your
		visitor used to get to a certain content. According to this variable,
		different Joomla! configurations are applied - e.g. what template will
		be used or what modules will be visible, etc.</p>
		<p>Since JoomSEF 1.4.0, several new configuration options are
		provided in "Advanced configuration" section. The option <em>"Exclude
		source info"</em> may be used to exclude the Itemid variable from the URL
		and thus eliminate the duplicates caused by it. However, ignoring it
		completely may lead to unwanted Joomla! functionality, like not
		switching the templates as desired or so. Whether this will be a
		problem for you or not depends mainly on the way how your site is
		designed and how complicated it is. If you need to fix this, the
		Itemid should be "reappended" to the SEF URL as an extra part using
		the option <em>"Reappend source"</em>. Then the resulting URL will
		look <em>http://yoursite.you/article.html&amp;Itemid=xy</em>.</p>
		<p>Since JoomSEF 2.0.0 there is a possibility to set your own
		Itemid for each extension that will always be used with it - thus even
		when <em>"Reappend source"</em> is set to Yes, that extension won't
		have the ?Itemid=xy appended. You can find this option in extension
		parameters. If you leave the <em>"Override Itemid"</em> field blank,
		the default Itemid will be used, but won't be appended as ?Itemid=xy
		in URL. Thus you can achieve that the ?Itemid=xy will be added only to
		those extensions that need it (mostly content). But be careful,
		setting Itemid to some random number can ruin your menu functionality!</p>
		<p>Another new option is <em>"Ignore multiple sources"</em>. If
		selected, only one URL will be created for each page using the first
		Itemid. Every other link varying in Itemid only will be ignored and
		the already created one will be used instead. But again - this can
		ruin your menu functionality! This option has no effect on extensions
		with custom Itemid set.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="cache" name="cache"></a>Cache</h3>
		<p>JoomSEF 2.0.0 introduces own cache functionality to decrease
		the amount of queries to your database. You can find this option in
		Advanced Configuration section.</p>
		<p>When caching is enabled, the most often used links will be kept
		in memory and will not require querying database every time. You can
		set the cache size (how many links can be stored in memory) and
		minimum hit count - only links with hit count greater than specified
		value will be stored in cache. Be careful about the cache size option
		- the more links in cache means less queries to database, but on the
		other hand bigger memory consumption.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="patches" name="patches"></a>Patch System</h3>
		<p>JoomSEF 2.0.0 also comes with the new Patch System. This will
		also decrease amount of queries made to database because everyone can
		use only those patches he needs, so no more "SELECT DATABASE()"
		queries if you use only one database.</p>
		<p>A patch is basically a mambot specifically designed to work with
		JoomSEF only. This means that you can use default Joomla! Mambot
		installer to manage these patches. Also every patch you install must
		be published in Site Mambots section in order to work.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="joomfish" name="joomfish"></a>JoomFish Support</h3>
		<p>There are several ways you can let JoomSEF build URLs on your
		multi-lingual site. They are displayed in JoomFish Related
		Configuration section of JoomSEF configuration when JoomFish is
		installed.</p>
		<p><strong>Language integration</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Include in path</strong> - with this option selected
			your URLs will look like www.mysite.com/en/somepage.html</li>
			<li><strong>Add as suffix</strong> - this option will make your
			URLs look like www.mysite.com/somepage_en.html</li>
			<li><strong>Use different domains</strong> - useful option if
			you have several domains registered for your site. Resulting URLs
			will look like http://en.mysite.com/somepage.html</li>
			<li><strong>Do not add</strong> - does not add any language code
			to URLs. Should be used only when <em>"Translate URLs"</em> option is
			active or it will create duplicate links.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Always use language</strong><br />
		With this option active the language code will always be added to
		resulting URL. This may decrease duplicate links count as there won't
		be two links (with and without language code) pointing to the same
		page.</p>
		<p><strong>Translate URLs</strong><br />
		Activate to have your URLs translated using JoomFish - this will
		improve the readability of your URLs for people preferring other
		languages.</p>
		<p><strong>Domain Configuration</strong><br />
		Here is the place to set custom domain for each language if you have <strong>Use
		different domains</strong> selected.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="components" name="components"></a>Component
		Configuration</h3>
		<p>In the Component Configuration section of JoomSEF configuration
		you can set some options for each component individually.</p>
		<p><strong>Handling</strong><br />
		Controls the way how links are processed.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Use default handler</strong> - JoomSEF will try to
			create the best looking URL it can using all available resources.</li>
			<li><strong>Nocache</strong> - JoomSEF will create URLs the same
			way as default Joomla! SEF does - they won't be stored in database
			and will look like
			www.mysite.com/component/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,50/</li>
			<li><strong>Skip</strong> - JoomSEF will not process URLs at all
			and they will look as with the SEF disabled entirely.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Custom title</strong><br />
		Lets you set your own extension title to use in URL instead of default
		menu title. Leave blank for default one. If you use JoomFish you can
		also translate these custom titles.<br />
		When checking the check box next to the custom title box, the menu
		title part of the URL will be left empty.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="urls" name="urls"></a>Modifying URLs</h3>
		<p>You can modify URL's to your liking. Go into the ARTIO JoomSEF
		Control Panel and click ' View/Edit SEF Urls'. Select the URL you wish
		to modify. If you click the check box labeled 'Save as Custom
		Redirect' it will place this URL into the 'Custom Redirect' area which
		you can navigate to from the ARTIO JoomSEF Control Panel. When you
		click 'View/Edit Custom Redirects' you will see your URL in here now
		instead. These urls will not be removed when you save the config. You
		can modify these and save them as you wish.</p>
		<p>This is particularly useful if you are updating from an old
		site because any URL's that are no longer available will be logged. You
		can view these URL's by clicking 'View/Edit 404 Logs' in the ARTIO
		JoomSEF Control Panel. You can redirect visitors to the new page by
		selecting the URL you wish to modify and entering the new url. Note:
		The ability to enter non-Joomla! URL's into this area is coming soon!
		This will allow you to easily transfer a non-Joomla! site to Joomla
		using ARTIO JoomSEF and any of your old URL's will be redirected to
		the new page within Joomla!.</p>

		<h3><a title="metadata" name="metadata"></a>Metadata and Page
		Titles Organization - JoomSEF Metabot</h3>
		<p>To organize and adjust your site metadata (such as title, meta
		desc, meta keywords, etc.] from one place, you may use features
		offered by JoomSEF Metabot. Metabot is installed as a standard Joomla!
		system mambot (plugin in Joomla 1.5.x) and takes care about
		composition of your page title and meta data in the page head section.</p>
		<p>Metabot will load the metadata you have defined for a certain
		SEF URL using the JoomSEF URL editor and will place them into the head
		section of your current Joomla! page.</p>
		<p>Hint: To define title and/or meta tags for your homepage (that
		has not really an URL generated by SEF, but composes just from your
		site base URL), create a new entry in the URL list where the SEF URL
		will stay blank and the original URL will say just index.php.</p>
		<p>For metabot, to work correctly, it must be used always with
		JoomSEF component and it has to be in published state. Metabot has
		also several user configurable option, such as the way how page / site
		name in page titles is organized and other metadata related settings.
		To access this configuration, find the ARTIO Metabot in installed
		Joomla mambots (plugins) list and click it. The configurable
		parameters then can be found on the right side of the mambot (plugin)
		detail page.</p>
		</li>

		<h3><a title="backup" name="backup"></a>Backing up your Custom
		URLs</h3>
		<p>It is recommended to backup your database before doing this.</p>
		<p>You can also import and export URL's from the Custom Redirect
		area. To do this click the 'Import/Export Custom URLS' link above the
		table of URL's. To backup your URL's click the 'Backup Custom URLS'
		button and you will be presented with a file named 'ARTIO
		JoomSEF_custom_urls.sql' to download.</p>
		<p>If you want to import your urls browse to the file and click
		the 'Import Custom URLS' button.</p>

	<h2><a title="exts" name="exts"></a>Supported Joomla! Components</h2>
	<ol
		style="list-style-type: upper-roman; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside">
		<li>
		<h3><a title="core" name="core"></a>Joomla! Built-in Components</h3>
		<p>The support for Joomla! core components, such as banners,
		content, contacts, news, newsfeeds, weblinks, etc. is already
		integrated in the JoomSEF component. Optimization of URLs for these
		components requires no further efforts.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h3><a title="ext" name="ext"></a>3rd Party Components</h3>
		<p>The situation is slightly different for 3rd party components.
		There exists many 3rd party components and modules for Joomla!, which
		usually differ significantly in complexity and structure. This means
		that for some of those (usually the simple ones), the SEO may
		work fine, while for other, you can experience, problems such as
		disfunctionality, insufficient SEO, or generation of duplicate URLs.
		These can be either skipped in JoomSEF Control Panel, so no SEF URLs
		will be generated for them, or will require a special "extensions".k
		using the the default JoomSEF component handler. The others (usually
		more complex ones) may cause problems when used with the default
		handler. Such problems may include errors, loss of fun</p>
		<p>Extensions are special pieces of code for JoomSEF, written with
		particular 3rd party component in mind (e.g. VirtueMart, JoomlaBoard,
		...}. Such extension can be either part of the component/module self
		(provided by component/module author), may come as part of JoomSEF
		installation package or be provided by 3rd parties. ARTIO offeres most
		of such extensions available for free as part of the JoomSEF
		distribution package. However, some of the extensions are provided
		also under commercial licence. Bellow, you may find list of official
		extensions available for JoomSEF.</p>
