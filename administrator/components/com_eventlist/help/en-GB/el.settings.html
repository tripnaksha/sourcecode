icons only if you had set the width at the layout settings.</p>

options and type in the Email address(es) of the recipient(s) seperated by a comma. Usefull

<p><strong>Enable Thumbnails:</strong><br />
EventList can create thumbnails if the GD library version 2 is
installed on your server. If it isn't available this feature will be disabled.
In this case the above typed in hight and width values will be used to resize the
images if they are larger than these values. Keep in mind that this method results
in a much lower quality than using the GD library. Also the filesize of the images aren't reduced.
